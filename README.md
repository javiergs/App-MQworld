A simple Java Swing application where multiple instances connect to a shared virtual grid and publish or receive each other’s positions in real time via MQTT.
It demonstrates the publish–subscribe pattern using the Eclipse Paho MQTT client library and a public MQTT broker. It also serves as a teaching tool for IoT and network-messaging courses, showing how devices share state through topics. Additionally, it offers a fun testbed for experimentation—change the topic, swap the broker, adjust the visuals, scale the world, or extend the logic however you like.
